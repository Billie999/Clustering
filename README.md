# Clustering
This task involves a bioinformatics problem specifically unsupervised clustering of gene-expression micro-array data. Two scenarios are considered:

a. Clustering different tissue samples based on their gene-expression levels across multiple genes (Activity 1).

b. Clustering genes according to their gene-expression levels across multiple experimental conditions (Activity 2 and Activity 3).
